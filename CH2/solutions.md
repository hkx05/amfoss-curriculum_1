1.True and False. They are used in while loops like 'While true' or in statements like 'spam=True'.
2.The three boolean operators are 'and', 'or' and 'not'
3.Using the boolean operator 'and':

	Expression		Evaluates to..
	True and True		True
	True and False		False
	False and True		False
	False and False		False	

  Using the boolean operator 'or':

	Expression		Evaluates to..
	True or True		True
	True or False		True
	False or True		True
	False or False		False

  Using the boolean operator 'not':

	Expression		Evaluates to..
	not True		False
	not False		True

4.False False True False False True
5.==
  !=
  <
  >
  <=
  >=

6.equal to operator or "==" is a comparison operator which checks if the LHS is equal to RHS and gives either True or False. assignment operator "=" is used to assign a value to a variable.
7.condition is just a more specific name in context of flow control statements. They always evaluate down to a Boolean value. Conditions are mostly used in loops, conditional statements like if and else.
8.The first block starts with the initialisation of 'spam' and includes the first if statement.
  The second block is the second if and else statement (spam>5)
  The third block is the 'print(spam)' after the else part of the second block.
9.spam = int(input("Enter a number : "))
  if  spam==1:
	print("Hello")
  elif spam==2:
	print("Howdy")
  else:
	print("Greetings!")

11.if break is used in a statement and it returns True, it'll break from the current loop and won't execute the further program, if continue is used, the current iteration is skipped and the rest of the iteration works.
12.in range(0), the for loop with a variable starts from 0 and iterates till 4
   range(0,10) is the same as the above one but in this, the starting and the ending values are given\
   in range(0,10,1) the starting, ending and the stepping argument is given, the output will be the same.
13.for i in range(1,11):
	print(i)

   i=1
   while i<11:
	print(i)
	i+=1
